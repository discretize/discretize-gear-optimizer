# Overview

The data located in [/src/assets/modifierdata](../../../src/assets/modifierdata) specifies what effect each trait, passive-buffing skill, rune, sigil, food, utility, and buff has on your character.

You can run `pnpm testData` in a clone of the repository to run the `testData.js` script, which will check every YAML file in this folder for most possible mistakes or omissions. This script will be run automatically by GitHub when you push to a the source branch of an open pull request, including draft PRs, so don't worry if you don't want to set up Node and PNPM just for this!

Note that this script is not perfect and may have bugs, so ask in Discord if something seems off or if you're not sure what the problem is!

You can also run `pnpm validateDataTypes` in the same way, which will verify that the Typescript types in `metadata.ts` describe the data correctly.

# Format

This data format was originally proposed in the [data format notes wiki page](https://github.com/discretize/discretize-gear-optimizer/wiki/data-format-notes) and some of the information there about future plans is still relevant.

### Organization:

Buffs, food, utility, sigils, and runes are split into sections for organization within the user interface.

Each class has a section for skills and a section for each traitline's traits. Note that there can be more than one item per individual trait, which you should do if a trait has more than one effect which the user might want to individually enable/disable (i.e. a trait with both a flat buff and an effect when using a greatsword).

### Example

```yaml
    - id: example
      text: Example Item
      subText: with hammer
      minor: true
      amountData:
        label: '% uptime'
        default: 50
        quantityEntered: 100
      modifiers:
        damage:
          Outgoing Strike Damage: [10%, mult]
          Outgoing All Damage: [20%, add]
          Outgoing Critical Damage: [20%, unknown]
          Burning Damage: [33%, unknown]
        attributes:
          Ferocity: [100, converted]
          Healing Power: [30, buff]
          Condition Damage: [60, converted]
          Critical Chance: 20%
          Quickness Duration: 10%
          Torment Duration: 25%
          Outgoing Healing: 5%
        conversion:
          Power: {Precision: 3%, Ferocity: 6%}
          Expertise: {Toughness: 3%}
          Outgoing Healing: {Healing Power: 0.006%}
      gw2id: 1234
      type: CommonEffect # gw2-ui component type (only used in buffs)
      defaultEnabled: true
```

(Of course you would never have all of these keys at once unless Arenanet runs out of expansion ideas and decides to go nuts.)

# Modifiers Section

> This section should align with [src/assets/modifierdata/metadata.js](../../../src/assets/modifierdata/metadata.js) but is not often updated; check that file for up-to-date information.

These fields apply to the required `modifiers` and optional `wvwModifiers` sections. `wvwModifiers`, if present, will completely override `modifiers` in WvW mode.

## damage

`key: [percentage amount, stacking mode]`

This section contains percentage bonuses to incoming/outgoing damage. One must specify if they stack additively or multiplicatively with each other, information which GW2 does not display anywhere and which must be inferred from ingame testing and arithmetic.

Two 50% multiplicative modifiers combine like this: (1 + 0.50) \* (1 + 0.50) = 2.25 => equivalent to one 125% modifier

Two 50% multiplicative modifiers combine like this: 1 + (0.50 + 0.50) = 2.00 => equivalent to one 100% modifier

**Keys:**

- Outgoing Strike Damage
- Outgoing Condition Damage
- Outgoing All Damage
- Damage Reduction
- Condition Damage Reduction
- Outgoing Critical Damage
- Outgoing Bleeding Damage
- Outgoing Burning Damage
- Outgoing Confusion Damage
- Outgoing Poison Damage
- Outgoing Torment Damage
- Outgoing Alternative Damage (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Outgoing Alternative Critical Damage (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Outgoing Phantasm Damage
- Outgoing Phantasm Critical Damage
- Outgoing Siphon Damage

(Note that the individual conditions' stacking modes don't currently matter, as I don't know of a way to have more than one.)

**Percentage amounts:**

These should always be percentages. (The percent character is technically meaningless; it's just there to clarify that these are percentages.)

**Stacking modes:**

- mult
- add
- target
- unknown

Use "unknown" if you don't know how a modifier stacks (defaults to "mult" at the moment, though better guesses may come in the future).

Use "add" for certain damage buffs that stack additively with each other. (Note that generic outgoing condition damage buffs have all been additive so far.)

Use "target" for damage buffs that are the result of an effect not on the player but on the target (vulnerability + exposed), which stack additively with each other separately from the other category. Yep, GW2's math is weird.

If an effect has both an additive and a multiplicative component, you can specify both with e.g. `Outgoing Strike Damage: [3%, add, 7%, mult]`. Yep, the syntax is kinda bad, sorry.

## attributes

`key: [amount of points, conversion mode]`

`key: percentage amount`

This section contains bonuses to player stats/attributes. Some are bonuses to attribute points (usually primary/secondary attributes), others are bonuses to percentages (usually derived attributes).

For attribute point bonuses, one must specify if they have an effect on "gain X based on Y" conversions like sharpening stones, information which GW2 does not display anywhere and which must be inferred from ingame testing and arithmetic.

**Keys (points/conversion):**

- [all 9 primary attributes]
- Agony Resistance
- Armor
- Alternative Power (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Alternative Precision (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Alternative Ferocity (i.e. in reaper shroud)

**Keys (percentage):**

- Critical Chance
- Alternative Critical Chance (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Phantasm Critical Chance
- Clone Critical Chance
- Boon Duration
- [all 12 boons] Duration
- Condition Duration
- Condition Duration Uncapped (see https://github.com/discretize/discretize-gear-optimizer/pull/677)
- Bleeding Duration
- Burning Duration
- Confusion Duration
- Poison Duration
- Torment Duration
- Maximum Health
- Outgoing Healing

**Keys (coefficient):**

- Power Coefficient
- NonCrit Power Coefficient (for e.g. air sigil)
- Power2 Coefficient (i.e. in reaper shroud)
- Bleeding Coefficient
- Burning Coefficient
- Confusion Coefficient
- Poison Coefficient
- Torment Coefficient
- Siphon Coefficient
- Siphon Base Coefficient (portion of lifesteal damage unaffected by power)
- Flat DPS (not affected by any stat)

**Conversion modes:**

- converted
- buff
- unknown

Use "unknown" if you don't know if a modifier is converted (defaults to "buff" at the moment, though better guesses may come in the future).

## conversion

`destination: {source 1: percentage amount 1, source 2: percentage amount 2}`

This section contains "gain X based on Y" stat conversions like sharpening stones.

**Destinations:**

- various

**Sources:**

- [all 9 primary attributes]
- Agony Resistance
- Armor

Note that you can just as easily write

```
conversion:
  destination:
    source 1: percentage amount 1
    source 2: percentage amount 2
```

if you prefer. (YAML supports switching from indentation to braces at any depth.)

## conversionAfterBuffs

`destination: {source 1: percentage amount 1, source 2: percentage amount 2}`

Similar to `conversion`, but sourced after other buffs are applied. This is used for on-critical-hit effects, so that their strength is scaled by the player's critical chance value.

**Destinations:**

- various

**Sources:**

- Critical Chance
- Clone Critical Chance
- Phantasm Critical Chance

# Amount Section

The `amountData` object allows trait effects to specify that the user can change the amount of the effect in the optimizer UI. Effects will be linearly scaled up or down based on how the user-specified amount compares to the `quantityEntered` value.

This can be used for stacking effects/effect-per-boon or to simulate effects with non-100% uptimes. Of course, simulating a 60% uptime of an effect as always having that effect at 60% strength is an approximation that is only accurate if a class' damage output isn't very spiky.

amountData is currently supported only in traits (skills are definitely planned, extras... maybe, we'll see.)

> todo: make this true
>
> Attributes affected by an uptime-based modifier at less than 100% uptime will be automatically marked in the results UI as approximate.

Using percentage uptimes on effects that can influence critical chance, boon/condition duration, toughness, damage reduction*, or maximum health* is not generally recommended. (Attributes with caps do not scale like this, and attributes that can be min/max filtered should be real.) This is enforced by the testModifers script. Use `disableBlacklist: true` to disable this check when it really does make sense to use it!

> see [src/assets/modifierdata/metadata.js](../../../src/assets/modifierdata/metadata.js) for the actual blacklist

\*perhaps these are fine once a visual indicator is added

### label

The label following the text in the textbox used to enter the amount. Should start with `%` if the user is to enter a percentage.

Note that strings beginning with a % character must be quoted in YAML files.

### default

The default quantity to simulate if the user does not specify one. This is a judgement call; just try and make reasonable assumptions about the most likely setup with this trait selected.

### defaultInput (optional)

Initial text to fill the quantity box with; use `???` to indicate that the user definitely needs to specify this quantity manually to use this effect.

### quantityEntered

The quantity corresponding to the base modifier data you have specified.

For example, might could be entered as `Power: [30, buff]` with `quantityEntered: 1`. It could, with the exact same result, be entered as `Power: [750, buff]` with `quantityEntered: 25`. Do whichever you want!

### disableBlacklist (optional)

This tells the testModifiers script not to warn you if you use amountData with the aforementioned values to be careful about. Don't be afraid to use this when it makes sense to, such as for Target the Weak (gain critical chance per condition on your opponent).

## Metadata

#### id

This string should uniquely identify the effect, as it's used throughout the codebase. Avoid special characters.

#### text

Usually unused (the optimizer just simulates the ingame UI using the gw2-UI library), but currently used in food items to show both regular and ascended variants.

> todo: possibly deprecate or remove this

#### textOverride (optional)

Used to override the UI text when representing something like "a slaying potion" that isn't represented by the single ingame item shown.

#### subText (optional)

Clarification text used to specify under what conditions this effect is being simulated and/or what sub-effect this is if there's more than one item for a trait.

#### minor (optional, traits)

Specifies if this is a minor trait (it will be displayed if its parent traitline is selected).

Minor traits without subtext or amount data are assumed to be always-on; if this minor trait effect should have a checkbox, add subtext indicating what condition its effect depends on.

#### gw2id (optional)

Numerical GW2 id of this effect. To find this, hover your mouse over the chatcode in the box on the right side of the GW2 wiki or file search in the files in [src/utils/mapping](../../../src/utils/mapping). Make sure your item is described in `subText` if not specifying a GW2 id to display.

#### displayIds (optional; extras only)

Array of numerical GW2 ids to show in the selection modal, if more than one item in the game has this effect.

#### priceIds (optional; extras only)

Array of numerical GW2 ids to select the cheapest price from if "show prices" is checked in the selection modal, if more than one item in the game has this effect. (This can be more complete than the priceIds list, which must be short enough not to overflow the UI.)

#### type (buffs only)

> source: [src/components/sections/buffs/Buffs.jsx](../../../src/components/sections/buffs/Buffs.jsx)

`Boon`, `Skill`, `Trait`, `CommonEffect`, `Condition`, or `Text`; used to specify what kind of component to use to render buffs.

(Food, utilities, runes, and sigils are always items; skills are always skills; traits are always traits. This can be changed if needed.)

#### defaultEnabled (traits only)

Specifies if this effect's checkbox should be checked when the user selects the corresponding trait for the first time. Often true. This is a judgement call; just try and make reasonable assumptions about the most likely setup with this trait selected.

#### hasLifesteal (optional; food only)

Specifies if this food effect should add lifesteal equal to the "lifesteal frequency" box in the UI.
