Internal data for what effects modifiers have (like traits, food, etc) and for all of the presets and templates are stored in YAML files in [/src/assets/modifierdata](../../../src/assets/modifierdata) and [/src/assets/presetdata](../../../src/assets/presetdata).

See [Templates and Presets](<Templates and Presets.md>) and [Modifiers](Modifiers.md) for information about the specific formats of those sections.

> To do: split up "trait" template files into traits / extras, to allow users to mix and match.

> To do: add a user interface (Netlify CMS) so contributors need not edit YAML directly.

If you've never seen YAML before, the big thing you need to know is that indentation is important! Make sure to copy-paste blocks of YAML including the whitespace at the beginning of the lines. Use an editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or an online tool like [transform.tools's editor](https://transform.tools/yaml-to-json) to see in real time if your YAML has problems.

```yaml
# text after a hash mark is a comment!
```

```yaml
# each key corresponds with one value!

a dictionary:
  a number: 123.45
  a string: hi             # quotation marks around strings are optional!
  a big string: >
    hello, this is
    an entire paragraph
    which is one string
```

```yaml
a list:
- apple
- banana
- carrot
```

```yaml
a list of dictionaries:

- class: revenant
  armor: heavy

- class: thief
  armor: medium

- class: mesmer
  armor: light
```

```yaml
a dictionary of lists:

revenant builds:
  - power alacrity
  - condi RR

thief builds:
  - condi deadeye
  - power daredevil

mesmer builds:
  - power chrono
  - condi mirage
```
